# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Tailwind CSS gradients.  The issue arises when the color transition between `from-` and `to-` is not visually distinct, leading to an unappealing or unexpected gradient effect.

## Bug Description
The problem is not a coding error but rather an aesthetic issue.  Using inappropriate color combinations can result in a gradient that is too subtle to be noticeable or simply doesn't look good. This can be easily missed, resulting in a less effective user interface.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the gradient effect. It appears weak and unappealing.

## Solution
The solution is simple: choose colors that transition well together and have sufficient contrast to create a pleasing gradient effect.  See `bugSolution.html` for an example.
